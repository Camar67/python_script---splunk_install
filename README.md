<p align="justify"> This program automates the installation of Splunk Enterprise and is developed for GNU/Linux distribution platforms compiled from RHEL such as CentOS Stream, Fedora, Oracle Linux, etc. The code was validated with the Community Edition of Splunk Enterprise on a CentOS Stream 9 box. In addition to Splunk downloading and installing, it also handles some miscellaneous underlying configurations such as file/directory rights, boot-start, firewall ports management, sweeping when exiting, etc. </p>
